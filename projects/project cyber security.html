            <h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
                Our company was tasked with developing a vintage clothing buying and selling website for a small business. The website lets customers browse and purchase vintage clothing items while providing the business owner a back-end system to manage inventory and orders. To meet the owner's requirements, the website also allows customers to sell their vintage clothing items, with the website acting as an intermediary and taking a commission on each sale.
                Our team implemented robust cybersecurity measures to ensure the website's security and protect the sensitive information involved. We utilized Kali Linux, a widely-used penetration testing platform, to identify and address any vulnerabilities. Additionally, we employed OWASP BWA (Broken Web Applications) to simulate real-world attacks and assess the website's resilience against common threats.
                We implemented a secure database system to securely store customer and seller data, including names, addresses, payment information, and contact details. Stringent privacy protocols were put in place to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information.
                By employing these cybersecurity tools and measures, we have created a secure platform for customers and sellers, ensuring their data protection. The website provides a reliable and trusted environment for buying and selling vintage clothing items while maintaining the privacy and security of all parties involved.

            <h4>Scenario</h4>
            <p>
                Our company has been hired to develop a buying and selling website for a small business specializing in vintage clothing. The website will feature vintage clothing items for customers to browse and purchase, and the business owner will have access to a back-end system to manage inventory and orders. Additionally, the website will store customer information, including names, addresses, and payment information. To meet the owner's request, the website will allow customers to sell their vintage clothing items, acting as an intermediary and taking a commission on each sale. To facilitate this, the website must store seller information, including contact information and bank account details for commission payouts.
