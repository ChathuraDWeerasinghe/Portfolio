            <h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
                The Electronic Warranty Management System is an innovative solution that leverages NLP, ML, QR scanning, blockchain, and encryption to modernize the warranty management process. Customers need help with warranty claim documentation in today's digital age. Most available warranty management systems need to be updated and improved in their service range, making it difficult for small customers to use them. Therefore, the author aims to design, implement, and evaluate a plan that covers a globally accessible system for the warranty sector.
                This project significantly contributes to the problem domain by streamlining the warranty management process and offering a secure and efficient solution for managing electronic warranties. Implementing NLP and ML allows for intelligent and automated warranty claims processing, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. QR scanning technology provides quick and easy access to product information and warranty status. Blockchain integration enhances the security and tamper-proof nature of warranty records, while encryption ensures the confidentiality of sensitive information.
                The system will be managed through a QR input and output system that simplifies the user's access to the design and is protected from behind. This project's contributions to technology are significant, with the building of a Global Warranty System that uses a QR scanning method, end-to-end encryption, and secure data storage systems. This simple contribution will maximize the system until it builds a Sharpe cut system. Several challenges must be addressed in researching the Electronic Warranty Management System, including ensuring the accuracy and reliability of NLP and ML algorithms, seamless QR scanning and access to product information, and robust security implementations.

            <h4>Probelm Domain</h4>
            <p>
                There are so many aspects to warranty, and a proper study of the subject needs a framework to integrate these. In today's culture, when we go to a shop and buy something that has a warranty value, the seller or the service provider should give us a written document/printed paper to sign in front of them and keep the paper document until the card period expires. Also, some systems can create unique documentation and bind it to the devices customers buy. But it's something annoying in today's world. We are purchasing items online, but when it comes to warranties and item safety, that's something we can figure out as the wrong side of online platforms. 
                When it comes to leading platforms that sell products and services online, Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay have a product protection time like they are guaranteed for the goods until those reach the customer's doorsteps. But a wide range of products can contain and undergo a warranty registration. But that's not usually happening since it's an online platform, and there are no proper solutions. Some product ranges and services, like Asus, Apple, Samsung, etc., have a system that stores product-related data and customer information that helps to keep their warranty details safe without any written paper documents. But most of the time, they also release a paper document for the customer to keep safe until it becomes useful or expires. 
                There are some software and web platforms that offer warranty systems. But they are limited in their service range to countries and regions. Therefore, those systems are outdated and do not match the author's idea. Therefore, implementing a warranty system is significant for today's world that can be accessible for all platforms, service providers, sellers, and customers.

            <h4>Research Gap</h4>
            <p>
                Based on previous research that has gone through warranty management systems, the author summarised that those researches are not for visioning or evaluating a global warranty system. Those were for warranty-related licenses, terms, and conditions. Therefore, the author tries to research, design, implement, and evaluate a plan that covers a globally accessible system for the warranty sector. Here, it works as a system with functionalities and security methodologies like end-to-end encryption, QR generating method, and secure data storage system. The system will manage through a QR input and output system that simplify the user access to the system but is protected from behind itself.
