            <h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
                In my project, complete with a focus on Java threading and Java File Service Protocol (FSP), I designed and implemented a shared printer system. The goal was to create a robust and efficient solution for multiple users to access and utilize a shared printer simultaneously.
                Using Java threading, I developed a multithreaded application that allowed users to submit print requests concurrently. The application employed thread synchronization techniques to ensure the orderly execution of printing tasks and prevent conflicts arising from simultaneous access.
                To facilitate communication and coordination between the users and the printer, I integrated the Java File Service Protocol (FSP). This protocol enabled seamless file transfer between the clients and the server, ensuring the efficient transmission of print jobs and printer status updates.
                In addition, I incorporated advanced features such as print job prioritization, error handling, and status monitoring. Users could submit print jobs, monitor the printer queue, and receive notifications on job completion or errors.
                The shared printer project demonstrated my deep understanding of Java threading concepts and showcased my ability to leverage them effectively to develop a concurrent system. Moreover, the Java File Service Protocol integration highlighted my proficiency in network protocols and facilitated seamless communication between the users and the shared printer.
