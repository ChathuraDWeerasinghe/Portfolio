            <h4>Abstract</h4>
			<p>
            The education industry is often derided and mocked by the student who usually benefits from it, with complaints of it not teaching them the life skills they need and of old-fashioned methods. However, a part of the story is the undeniable truth that attendance matters in education. Students often skip classes or even whole days of study for various reasons that range from a lack of interest in their studies to a false sense of bravado to even other, more nefarious reasons.
            A key contributor to this trend is the lack of oversight that would allow for students skipping classes and school to be easily identified and brought to task, especially in the more prominent educational institutes, where the individual courses can have more students than a single teacher/lecturer can keep track of. This is exacerbated because the students can easily overcome the few safeguards against such action with little effort.
            Verbose, the proposed solution, attempts to assess the feasibility of solving this dilemma by using voice recognition and speech analysis to mark and authenticate students' attendance to benefit all stakeholders involved in this segment of the education industry.

            <p>
                The Education Industry is a facet of life that takes the recording of students' attendance very seriously. Since time immemorial, marking their attendance is the most common activity at the start of a student's school day. However, this is another constant in students' lives through the ages, and this is the penchant to skip specific classes or even school itself. Current widespread methods in Primary & Secondary Educational Institutions that rely on old-school methods, such as a physical attendance book, can be deceived easily, as many students would quickly tell you. As for Tertiary Educational Institutions, while the method & security of their attendance recording measures depend on the specific Institution, there is no standard method or uniformity in how these maintained records are stored or processed. This is where a Vocal-Pattern Analysis & Identification system can truly shine.

            <h4>Aim</h4>
            <p>
                “To research, design, prototype, and evaluate the potential of VRSA, ML, and Blockchain to record Student Attendance Securely and Accurately.” To elaborate on the above further, this project aims to research how Attendance records are obtained and recorded currently, at both the high school and University levels, and what flaws exist in these systems that allow for deception and manipulation. The goal is to design and prototype a system that can resolve these issues based on the data obtained from the research by utilizing VRSA, ML, and Blockchain.
