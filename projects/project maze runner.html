            <h4>Description</h4>
			<p>
                In a project completed in 2021, I delved into the exciting world of Java threading and the concept of File Service Protocol (FSP) while developing a captivating maze runner mini-game. The project aimed to create an interactive game where a player navigates through a maze, encountering various challenges and obstacles.
                Utilizing Java's threading capabilities, I implemented concurrent programming techniques to ensure smooth gameplay and responsiveness. Using threads allowed for the simultaneous execution of multiple game elements, such as character movement, enemy behavior, and obstacle generation.
                Furthermore, File Service Protocol (FSP) integration facilitated seamless communication and file sharing between the game client and server, enabling multiplayer functionality. Players could compete against each other, collaborating or competing as they explored the maze.
                The project demonstrated my proficiency in Java threading and showcased my ability to leverage FSP to enhance gameplay. It also highlighted my skills in game development, including maze generation algorithms, character control, and multiplayer networking. Overall, the maze runner mini-game project showcased my creativity and technical expertise in threading and network protocols.
